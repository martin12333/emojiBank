### emojiBank ###

emojiBank is a chrome extension designed to make it easier to use and save text-based emoji that use uncommon characters. It is currently available on the extension store, get it [here](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/emoji-bank/ongfceokaejanhleffnndeelojpkefeg "emojiBank")!

#### using emoji ####

When the extension is opened, the user can see a list of emojis they have saved. Clicking an emoji automatically selects the emoji, and all you have to do is use ctrl/command + c to copy it and paste it wherever you need!

Use the search bar at the top to search for emojis by tag (see more info on tagging below).

#### saving + tagging emoji ####

By selecting the add emoji button, you can save new emojis into chrome's local storage. Additionally, emojis can have tags added to them for easier searching later. When adding an emoji, add any relevant tags separated by commas and save!

#### deleting emoji ####

Accidentally add an emoji? Getting sick of one? No problem! Deleting an emoji is as easy as selecting it and hitting the delete button. Warning: This can't be reversed!

#### misc ####

emojiBank is entirely operable with your keyboard! Set a keyboard shortcut to open it for maximum efficiency.

#### future additions ####

While emojiBank is fully functional, it is still in early development and there are many great features to be added in the future. These include:

- Syncing with chrome (to save your emoji across computers)
- Upload of emojis via text files
- A library of emoji to browse through and add to your list
- More keyboard shortcuts and macros to make it as easy and seamless to incorporate emoji into your posts/conversations.

Enjoy!
