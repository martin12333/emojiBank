### emojiBank ###

emojiBank is a chrome extension designed to make it easier to use and save text-based emoji that use uncommon characters.

#### using emoji ####

When the extension is opened, the user can see a list of emojis they have saved. Clicking an emoji automatically selects the emoji, and all you have to do is use ctrl/command + c to copy it and paste it wherever you need!

#### saving emoji ####

By selecting the add emoji button, you can save new emojis into chrome's local storage. Simply click the button, enter your emoji and hit save!

#### deleting emoji ####

Accidentally add an emoji? Getting sick of one? No problem! Deleting an emoji is as easy as selecting it and hitting the delete button. Warning: This can't be reversed!

#### misc ####

emojiBank is entirely operable with your keyboard! Set a keyboard shortcut to open it for maximum efficiency.

#### future additions ####

While emojiBank is fully functional, it is still in early development and there are many great features to be added in the future. These include:

- Syncing with chrome (to save your emoji across computers)
- Tagging, sorting and searching emoji
- Upload of emojis via text files
- More keyboard shortcuts and macros to make it as easy and seamless to incorporate emoji into your posts/conversations.

Enjoy!
